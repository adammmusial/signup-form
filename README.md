# Registration Form
<a href="https://signup-form-am.netlify.app/">Live Demo </a>

## About the Project
I created a registration form using HTML and CSS. It has fields for first name, surname, email, password, and password confirmation. The form has a modern design with floating labels, smooth transitions, and a cool blurred background. Itâ€™s also responsive, so it looks good on different screen sizes. This project helped me get better at form styling and making responsive designs.
